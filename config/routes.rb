  #just resources :assets was causing problems because rails assets has a fixed route.
  #The following workaround works so that "s3_assets_path" should work instead of just "assets_path"
  #resources :assets, :path=>'s3_assets', :as=>'s3_assets'
   #this route is for file downloads
  #match "s3_assets/get/:id" => "s3_assets#get", :as => :download
  
  
  
  #If you examine this code, youâ€™ll see that authenticated users 
  #(those who have an account and are logged in) will see the home/index page as the application root 
  #(or home) page. And all other users (those who donâ€™t have an account or who are not logged in) 
  #will see the same home page. The redundancy serves a didactic purpose: 
  #If you decide you want users to see a different page when they log in, 
  #you now know exactly where to change it.
